# C++ games repo

I'm an enthusiastic C++ programer who enjoys coding games and game-related algorithms. 

List of games I have in mind: 
1. [Tictactoe](https://github.com/amonteir/games/tree/master/tictactoe)
   * STATUS: fully functional windows console game available now. 2 difficulty levels: easy and godlike. For the latter, I implemented the minimax algorithm.
   * TBD: Add graphical interface using SDL framework. Work in progress.
2. Tetris
3. Basic platforms game
4. Basic fighting game
5. Beat 'em up game

I am groot.
