# C++ games repo

I'm an enthusiastic C++ programer who enjoys coding games and game-related algorithms. 

List of games I have in mind: 
1. [Tictactoe](https://github.com/amonteir/games/tree/master/tictactoe)
   * STATUS: fully functional windows console game available now. 2 difficulty levels: easy and godlike. For the latter, I implemented the [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm.
   * [GUI version](https://github.com/amonteir/games/tree/master/tictactoe_gui): Added a graphical interface using [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/). TBD: improve main menu, add audio and improve images.
2. Pac-Man
3. Basic platforms game
4. Basic fighting game
5. Beat 'em up game

I am groot.
