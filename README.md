# C++ games repo

I'm an enthusiastic C++ programer who enjoys coding games. List of games I have in mind: 
1. Tictactoe
    STATUS: fully functional windows console game available now. 2 difficulty levels: easy and godlike. For the latter, I implemented the minimax algorithm.
    TBD: Add graphical interface using SDL framework. Work in progress.
2. Tetris
3. Basic platforms game
4. Basic fighting game
5. Beat 'em up game

Enjoy free code
