# Tic Tac Toe game in C++98

After passing a C++ beginners course on Udemy, I decided to start my own adventure in C++ development and I thought 
that games can teach you a lot about programming. And I love games. So it's a 2x1 for me really, as to many of you, 
I'm sure.

The next question was, which game do I choose as my first game? I picked Tic Tac Toe because the it's one of the simplest
games you can find in terms of board size and game complexity. Also, it seemeed sensible to me to start by developing a 
console version before venturing into graphics APIs.
